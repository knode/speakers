# Request for contributions

Please contribute:
- Speaker pages **only for yourself**.
- Factual corrections, such as changed dates, location, or new talks.
- Clearer wording and general copy editing, spelling, and generally improving the
  quality of the content.
- Formatting to help keep content consistent and easy to read.

If you would like to propose a change that is substantially different from the current format
of this repo, consider opening a discussion in an Issues thread before spending time on a big
Pull Request.


# How to contribute

Prerequisites: familiarity with [GitHub PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (pull requests) and issues.
Knowledge of Markdown for editing `.md` documents

- Discuss proposed changes in an Issue.
- If submitting a Speaker Page, please follow the template
  closely. You can verify that you have filled out your markdown file
  properly by running `node index.js | python -mjson.tool`.
- Submit changes in a Pull Request, fixing one thing. If a pull request is too broad, we may ask
  that you split it up so that each change may be addressed individually.
- Pull requests can be merged by contributers with commit access once all open questions have been
  resolved and there are 2 or more +1's from other committers on the PR, accounting for commits which
  may have been added or removed.

# Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
or similar personal characteristic.

On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.

Please keep generalize project critique to a minimum. Focused, pointed comments
are the most helpful. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make
a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
including the definition in the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/);
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
[CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/jden/CONTRIBUTING.md) core team
immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about
making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.


# Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues
are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused
on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.
