# speakers

A repository of Node speakers. A template is
provided to add yourself: simply copy the `template/` directory
to `city-state-country/`, and rename the file to `your-human-name.md`,
and send a pull request. Please refrain from submitting a speaker page for other people. If there is a speaker you particularly enjoyed, contact them (politely!) and encourage them to submit a PR to this repo.

## audience

This repository's intended audience is organizers and
prospective speakers at node meetups. The intent is to enable communication among organizers and speakers: It should help match organizers with speakers, and provide a platform on which speakers might publish their talks and swap notes between themselves about what worked well and what did not.
