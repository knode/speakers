## About me

I'm Justin. I've been programming for many years. I'm self-taught. I dig talking because it provides me an excuse to dig deeper into a topic, as well as a method of share my findings with others.
As for formats, I'm happy with a tour of code, if there's a particular repo of mine that catches your eye. Also into standard speaker + slides or round table discussion things.

I'm into a bunch of stuff, including: 

- static analysis
- writing testable code
- playing with irc bots
- application structure and architecture
- technical paper discussion
- computer science (and education thereof)
- tooling as a general concept
