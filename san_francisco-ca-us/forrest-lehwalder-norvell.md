## About me

I'm a Node engineer for New Relic who has contributed significantly to their
instrumentation for Node.js. I've been using Node professionally since 2011,
co-ran one of the session tracks at NodeConf 2013, and have contributed some
small pieces to Node core. My most significant public project aside from
[node-newrelic](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic) is probably
[continuation-local storage](https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage),
of which I am the primary maintainer. No server-side JavaScript is too gross
for me to be interested in.

Node is a great platform but it can be scary to get started with, and it can
continue to be scary to plumb its depths. I'm comfortable with Node's (and
JavaScript's) many idiosyncracies and awkward design tradeoffs and really enjoy
helping other people get more comfortable as well. Having done all of free-form
talks with questions, formal presentations, and hands-on workshops, I enjoy all
three, although I do better when there are frequent opportunities for
questions.

## Talks / Workshops

### Domains: your friends and neighbors

| **location**: | NodeConf 2013 |
|:--------------|----------------------------:|
| **when**:     | 2013-06                  |
| **materials**:   | http://othiym23.github.io/nodeconf2013-domains/#/ |
| **duration**:   | 8 x 60m |
| **audience size**: | ~40 attendees per session |

Domenic Denicola and I co-presented a hands-on workshop on Node's domains. I
specifically pitched this session to Mikeal Rogers because I felt that domains
were underused but quite powerful. The sessions were very well-received and
I've continued to get feedback and field questions about domains ever since. I
also reviewed the material for a PDXNode meeting. It was a ton of work, but I
think I learned as much as the attendees and it left me with a lasting fondness
for hands-on workshops.

I spent at least 1 second coming up with a title for my deck.

### Thinking asynchronously

| **location**: | RealtimeConf 2013 |
|:--------------|----------------------------:|
| **when**:     | 2013-10                  |
| **materials**:   | http://www.slideshare.net/othiym23/rtc-2013 |
| **duration**:   | 12m |
| **audience size**: | large |

A distillation of a talk I delivered to my colleagues at New Relic about the
importance of modeling data flow asynchronously, and the implications of
asynchronous data modeling.  It was kind of an esoteric topic and it is
something I continue to think about and refine, but it's a subject that's near
and dear to my heart.

### Beyond the MEAN stack

| **location**: | Node Summit 2013 |
|:--------------|----------------------------:|
| **when**:     | 2013-12                  |
| **materials**:   | http://www.slideshare.net/othiym23/beyond-the-mean-stack-thinking-small-with-nodejs-for-the-enterprise |
| **duration**:   | 20m |
| **audience size**: | medium |

Aimed more at technical managers and people choosing the tools to be used for
new projects than core developers, this talk attempted to show the breadth of
the Node ecosystem as a means of showing that to standardize on an "optimal
stack" was to negate a lot of the advantage of choosing Node in the first
place. The audience feedback was positive and Eran Hammer told me he thought my
jokes were funny, which made me happy.
