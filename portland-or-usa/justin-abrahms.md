## About me

I'm Justin. I've been programming for many years. I'm self-taught. I dig talking because it provides me an excuse to dig deeper into a topic, as well as a method of share my findings with others.
As for formats, I'm happy with a tour of code, if there's a particular repo of mine that catches your eye, standard speaker + slides or round table discussion things.

## Topics

* static analysis
* writing testable code
* playing with irc bots
* application structure and architecture
* technical paper discussion
* computer science (and education thereof)
* tooling as a general concept
